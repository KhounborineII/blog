This was another great lab that helped me learn the process of controlling the
layouts of my pages! While it was short, this allowed me to learn how to manage and
ensure other pages I may create to have different layouts than the default minima
provided by Jekyll(or Ruby, or both). Everything in this lab was simply moving files
around, copying and pasting from other locations so nothing "new" was learned, but
I do now have access to the HTML files that will allow me to adjust the layout and
overall visuals of the blog!

If you actually looked at the links I posted on the [Introduction Post](https://khounborineii.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2021/09/10/introduction-post.html), I
am sorry that I pulled out the oldest trick in the internet trolling book. I mean
it was obvious that it was a trick, but what trick was it exactly? I knew some would
fall for it out of curiosity.

If you saw the [Creation](https://khounborineii.github.io/blog/creation/) Page, I
talked about how I spent 9 continuous hours creating an original character for comics
in my Beginning Drawing class.

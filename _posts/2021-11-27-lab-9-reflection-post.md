Ignore the time of this post. Besides the IP problems shown on campus, the lab
was interesting. I would go to say that this lab was very interesting! Setting up
a server in Azure and watching it run on a remote server using a web link was great.

By following the tutorial, the whole process felt easy. Working with my project
partners just allowed us to complete the lab even faster.

The only problem that was there was only just the IP problem. Once doing the lab
at home, I was able to complete the lab quickly with minimal to no problems.
I do not know how well the website will do in its "pre-completed" state once
we finish it, but I hope it will work nicely with the Azure servers.

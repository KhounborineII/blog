The Title Extender changes were a success. I did have to limit the Stateful Widget to only affect the Title and Title Extender Button however. A minor change that makes all the difference when it comes to building the Event Dialog pop-up. Rather than force a rebuild of the whole pop-up, it should only rebuild the title section and the button. The button will disappear and the title will be extended to its whole length. The Event Card was also made limited to two lines rather than four. My colleagues found that four lines was too much.

Now, I am working to simply replace an old icon and incorporate a new one. The old icon was the one that let users know of new events on the app that they have not read; however, with us developers being new to the app, we did not realize what it meant and some did not even notice its existence. As of today, we replaced this icon for a more noticeable icon. What I must complete before the next meeting is the addition of a new icon on the Event Dialog pop-up. This one will let users email Hendrix Today staff to report any issues with the event.

In other news, Algorithms. Is this complacency I'm feeling? In years past I was diligent. When there was an assignment to be done, I did it. Yet, here I am, having an assignment due Friday untouched nearly a week after it has been assigned. Is this what any person with lower grades feel, this empty feeling? Lacking the resources to properly understand and work on this assignment, I'm left to sink into this hopelessness, this despair. This is the last stretch, the final battle before the freedom of a degree. I can do this. I can get out of this. One way or another I'll get this done.

Now that the previous week's introduction into Disco Tray Studios is over and all new members have finally been added to the live version of the [Disco Tray Studios Website](https://discotraystudios.github.io/), we are now starting up work on the projects!

I have volunteered to be on the team that will put the finishing touches on the Hendrix Today App! Us developers already have a working prototype with the firebase backend installed onto our phones, and it seemingly works really well. However there are still minor issues that Olivia Larson, Johnathan Qualls, and I will put to rest before the app can truly go live to the Hendrix College community! Soon, our email addresses will not be bloated by countless emails!

The issue that I am currently set upon is one regarding the character limit of event titles. There was an egregious event title from the previous semester seen on the app that lasted around 300+ characters! If no hard limit is made, there could be more. Thankfully, this week is rounded off by Labor Day Weekend, giving us a three-day weekend to make sure these changes are made. This is my first true assignment as a member of Disco Tray Studios, and I dare not mess this up!

(Considering I already kind of did when updating the app's dependencies. I cloned the master repository rather than my fork and sent my fellow members on a wild goose chase trying to resolve it! Sorry Johnathan!)

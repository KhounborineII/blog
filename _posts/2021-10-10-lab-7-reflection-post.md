SO. This lab was very interesting and very fun to. There were a lot of parts to
it, but I think I understand the gist of it enough to be able to work on the
Solar Eclipse website. The entire tutorial process went well; however, I did have
one large initial hiccup at the beginning.

There seemed to be a problem regarding temporary files or something that occurred
when I built the project after a period of time. It may have been the ISS
complaining that I didn't close it after large updates to the project, but I am
not really sure. I deleted the project and restarted it several times because of
this mysterious problem. Eventually, I stopped running into it later in the process
once I started occasionally exiting out the ISS to re-host the local webpage after
saving and making changes to the files.

In creating a personal database with stuff that I liked, I actually did the
tutorial twice basically. I didn't realize that I had to translate the tutorial
to work with my database instead of simply doing movies; so, I did the tutorial
two times: the first for the movies and the second for my data.

The difference between this and Jekyll is vast and a little overwhelming, but if
I look at it long enough it shouldn't be too bad. I do understand from the tutorial
however that adding new columns for a database that is already working is a tedious
process requiring the developer to go into all the CREATE, DELETE, EDIT, DETAIL files
just to make sure the UI has the new column there.

If I were to rate my ability to make another Razor app I'd say a 7/10. Its mainly
on the part that I may not remember things for C# and certain coding aspects like
the one to create the search bar and such.

As required per the lab instructions: [My Lab 7 Repository](https://github.com/KhounborineII/csci340lab7).

I almost thought I had to link it through my KhounborineII.github.io website.

Thank you for clearing that up!

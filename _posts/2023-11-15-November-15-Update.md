Much progress has been made towards the app. The issues I was assigned have been dealt with swiftly thanks to the Data Structures already in place for the list of Events. It was a unique implementation of the ListView which created the whole list of events, and I was able to adjust it so that it would also add SizedBoxes and Text widgets in the ListView as well. There is a slight problem however. I neglected to also set the color of the new text in the list and so it barely appears in the Light Mode due to it being basically white text. I will have to quickly adjust it so we are prepared for Friday, when we meet once more with the Hendrix Today people to talk about the app, its future, and how to send Notifications since those work. The end of this semester is upon us, and I'm not sure I am motivated enough to keep going. At least earlier this week I reconciled with *things* and now feel like a whole person with a singular true identity. This song is nearly at its end, and yet the journey never does.

Riddled with a fever, I was unable to do much work this week, but that did not mean I did not try. I tried to do work as much as I could yet progress was slow. This new issue that needs solving is something else. Organizing the events by date, which is already a thing, but now separate them by a larger gap and perhaps add a date label to each section. In this sense, I would have to separate this list of events into sub-lists which all still have to be parsed by the categories and search bar. This may be easier than I think, but I have not really looked at the specifics. At this point it has been a lot of theories and potential solutions. I have also been assigned to fix the resource screen buttons. This is really Olivia's playing field but I won't turn down an issue assigned by Dr. Goadrich. If I did it a little sooner, I could have made the Database and Web Systems class a little more interesting. I'm not sure what he needs from the resource screen is possible considering the built-in font size changers of iPhones and Androids. I hope I can find those values and adjust accordingly, similar to the screen width of wider devices. Once I recover, I can keep going, just as I always have. Free from Signalis Brainrot, its time to get to work.

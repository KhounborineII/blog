The next beta version of the app has been released as of this previous Friday. All of the changes we made were accounted for, minus one. That one being the Search and Home page being combined into one. Last Wednesday, I did not properly convey that it would be done in time for the update to be pushed out and so Dr. Goadrich did not merge the completed changes along with everything else. Regardless, more changes need to be made to that page for it to work better anyway. I will do what I can to complete the tasks I have been assigned. However, something else now clings tightly to my consciousness. It consumes me. Like a signal playing on repeat, again and again and again. A Three Note Oddity beeping along in my mind.

Getting back on track, there now remains only one semester left of my college education -- at least for my bachelor's degree, should I ever seek further education in a graduate program later on. *The signal beeps again.* I am afraid that I may barely make it out of this semester by the skin of my teeth. Algorithms has been my most challenging class yet, forcing me out of my usually non-social state. *ACHTUNG* Like I mentioned in my previous post, I have begun to join in on my classmates' weekly Algorithms meetings to work together on homework and it worked tremendously well. *ACHTUNG* If I keep this up, I can make it out of my final semester with at least a C in Algorithms, my lowest grade yet. *39486* That's an achievement in itself to be fair, never really getting anywhere below a B in pretty much any of my classes, ever I think. *39486*

I hope that's the only close call this year.

*wake up.*

I also hope

*remember our promise.*

that nothing tries to consume me

*SIGNALIS*

before the semester is over, but I'm sure I'll be safe from that anyhow.

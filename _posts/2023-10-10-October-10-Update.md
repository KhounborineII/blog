As you can see, this post is later than expected. The reason for this being the iROS convention I attended last week which lasted from Sunday to Wednesday. From there I had to pick up the pieces of what remained, that being the work that still needs to be done for Disco Tray as well as my Algorithms class. Algorithms was prioritized, and it most likely still is. The work I must do is incredible. The Hendrix Today app needs to have these updates of which I have been unable to work on for nearly two weeks. With the Fall Break coming soon, I only hope all my work is complete; and yet, I know that may not be the case. I also hope that my colleagues will forgive me. Come what may, we shall live on. We must.

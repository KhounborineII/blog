Today, I beginning a new venture into Hendrix's Computer Science community. I am now a member of Disco Tray Studios! In this, I will be working alongside my fellow students to fully complete many of the final projects students have previously worked on. Why is this important? The importance of Disco Tray Studios is to finish these projects/products that will finally reach the client it was originally intended for! What many of us here were working on as final projects (websites, mobile apps, and games) were simply prototypes for what Disco Tray Studios will then later pick up to fully realize.

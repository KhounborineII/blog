The first week of true work in Disco Tray Studios has been completed! The issue I was assigned on Hendrix Today was completed with it; however, I now have to reimplement those changes so that it works even better than before. Originally, the fixes I made limited the length of long event titles. For what it was required to do, it worked. Now, there has to be a way to still view the full title, which does not work with my current implementation of the title limit.

In theory, using substrings of the title and a button that looks like an ellipsis should do the trick. If the title surpasses the character limit, the title will be cut as a substring at the limit and the ellipsis button will be visible and active. Once this button is pressed, the whole title is revealed and the button disabled and invisible. I hope this is as simple as I think it is, but I will have to create a couple functions that do this without messing with the UI too much.

In today's session of Disco Tray, we also got to test the Hendrix Career Competencies Game, an engaging visual novel experience built in RenPy. I did not realize it was RenPy until the game had booted up and was shocked to see the familiar UI appear. Its tree of decision-making was far more complex than I had ever expected and was speechless to how well it was all put together. Its a far cry from any of the more linear Visual Novels I experienced before and its one I can really consider as a game. Soon, an anime girl will virtually lead all upcoming students around campus through a visual novel, truly brilliant!

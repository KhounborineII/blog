Alright! This is actually the third time I had to create this file since:
1. I forgot to make the extension `.markdown`
2. I did not realize the Professor wanted a specific name for this posts
Now back to how I feel about doing this.

It's pretty cool! I had to improvise when it came to installing Ruby and its
gems due to some odd errors or uninstalled plugins in the bundle, but thankfully
there were others on the internet that had the same problem so I could just use
the simple solutions they found.

This whole process was new to me, having to google most of the steps that the
lab page did not explain. For example:
* Using `cd` in the command prompt to get to the copied repository
* Removing the `.txt` from the `Gemfile.txt` so the cmd recognizes it
* Editing these files in Atom rather than in notepad (This one was kind of
  self-explanatory, but I wasn't thinking clearly I suppose)

Also this helps with getting used to using markdown syntax so that's great!
One last thing, even though I could easily just not have it linked, **PLEASE DO
NOT GO TO MY [TWITTER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)**!!!

Technically nothing "wrong" with it, but its definitely not the first thing you'd
think about when going on to Twitter. Besides that however, this blogging will
certainly be interesting to do further down the line.

Oh wow almost did all of the requirements for Step 6 without even realizing that
there were requirements to begin with! Here's the last thing that needs to be put
in, [Have you ever heard of...](https://freetrial.finalfantasyxiv.com/na/)

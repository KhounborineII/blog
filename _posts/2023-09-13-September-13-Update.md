The readjustments of the Event Title extenders have been made! Due to the Event Dialog widget being Stateless, I initially believed that I needed to make the whole widget Stateful so that a TextButton would work properly. However, I was later informed that I could simply put a Stateful widget that only encompassed the Event Title and its extender button WITHIN the Stateless Event Dialog widget. I suppose I still have much to learn when it comes to proper coding of Flutter. Yet I know writing perfect code does not come easy. There are times when one must go back and refactor their working code into something much more readable and coherent. What I had last week was just a start, and now I hope this satisfies the criteria for what should be proper Flutter coding ethic.

I must learn this fast, else I would look incompetent in the eyes of future employers. I can at least say that when my own mistakes arise, I can easily find the desired solution and adjust to it. Sometimes I fear I won't be able to reach the desired work hours by the simple matter of fact that I work too quickly. Once I find a solution, it is there, found, and "so it is written." I do find it hilarious how true it is of software developers consistently approaching StackOverflow for solutions to their problems. I will admit there are many cases, but its not just blatant stealing of code. The solutions I find are too general and never specifically for what I need that I at least take the bare concept of what it is and apply it. Not one single line, not one single variable of my code in Disco Tray Studios ever directly come from a third party source. I wanted to make that absolutely clear.

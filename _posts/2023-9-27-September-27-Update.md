The new Beta Test for the Hendrix Today app is almost ready! We have run into an unexpected new issue though! It turns out some work one of my colleagues did to prevent the font sizes from destroying the neat layout of the app only applies to large fonts. When normal to small sized fonts are applied, the layout is once again disrupted. We believe next week we should have a Beta Test ready app. This may also have issues though since I will be gone from Saturday to the following Wednesday on a Hendrix Odyssey trip at a Robotics Conference. This will most likely not give me enough time to work on the app let alone anything else I am trying to work on. I should let my colleagues know of this and adjust accordingly.

Besides these issues, there is not much else to relay. New issues regarding bringing the search function to the homepage as well as limiting the width of the Event Dialog pop-up so that it does not stretch ridiculously on larger screens such as a tablet in horizontal mode.

This has been your Weekly Disco Tray Studios Update. Man the days of the Daily Elden Ring Update videos has me in a nostalgic mood right now.

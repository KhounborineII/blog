Isaac Khounborine is a Hendrix College Undergraduate planning to be a Computer
Science major.

Why am I doing this in third person? I don't know. Enough with that, here I am!
Learning about computers and how they work and how the internet works, websites, etc.
has always been interesting to me. The effort it takes into making such a completely
connected network continues to baffle me even when I learn more about how it all works.

Technology is always evolving and Computer Science, along with programming, will
always be a part of that process. I hope to be a person who can commit my own
efforts to see technology evolve even further.

Creating things, any things, I realize is possibly one of the most satisfying feelings
a person could have. Toiling to create a program, a drawing, or any sort of thing
that takes effort and work is amazing. Especially when it was made out of passion
alone. One day(yesterday, as of the creation of this page) I spent 9 whole hours just
drawing and creating an original character I needed for my Beginning Drawing class.
It was cathartic. I felt alive as much alive as I was seeking to make my drawing.

I know I am not the best at drawing hence being in a Beginning Drawing class, yet I
felt purpose in my work, satisfaction in it. It felt little different than coding
my own programs(minus the excruciating pain of working out bugs). That high of
creativity urges me on even now. "GO! Continue drawing your character! You have
ideas in your head and you must use them now!" The only thing stopping me is my
obligations to my other work.

It is strange to talk about the passion of creating a drawing while in an MD file
which should be about my passion of coding. Yet, as I am here, you should assume that
my passion for coding is the same.
